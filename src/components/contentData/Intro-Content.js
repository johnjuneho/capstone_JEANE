Over the years, researchers made incredible strides in developing AI technologies, from early programs that could play chess to today's sophisticated systems that power virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant. Along the way, there have been ups and downs, breakthroughs and setbacks, but the quest to create truly intelligent machines continues to drive innovation in the field of AI.",

      text: "Now, let's take a peek behind the scenes and see how AI powers ChatGPT! ChatGPT is a type of AI called a large language model, which means it's trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like responses to text input. When you ask ChatGPT a question or start a conversation, it analyzes the words you've typed and uses its knowledge to craft a response that makes sense. It's like having a virtual conversation partner who's always ready to chat about anything you want!",
