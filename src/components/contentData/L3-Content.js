It's like playing a word game with a computerâ€”we need to pick our words really carefully! As we have learned, large language models predict the next words. We need to think like AI and choose our words carefully!",

            "Correct:  Think of asking ChatGPT a question like searching for a hidden treasure. If your map (the question) is super detailed, you're way more likely to find the gold (the answer you need). Specific questions lead you straight to the treasure!",
